# Regression Analysis to Simplify the Complex Data Relationship and gain insight about Taxi Fares.

This notebook focuses on feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using a linear regression approach. The key takeaways from this notebook are as follows:

## 1. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a crucial step in preparing data for modeling. In this project, mean distance and mean duration were created as new features by grouping trips with the same pickup and dropoff locations. These features capture the average distance and duration for each group of trips. By incorporating these engineered features, we aim to improve the predictive power of our model.

## 2. Model Training
A linear regression model was trained using the selected features, including mean_distance, mean_duration, passenger_count, VendorID, and rush_hour. By leveraging the scikit-learn library, we employed an efficient and robust training algorithm to learn the relationships between these features and the target variable.

## 3. Model Evaluation
To assess the accuracy and predictive power of our trained model, we evaluated it on both the training and testing datasets. Several performance metrics were calculated, including R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics provide insights into how well our model fits the data and how accurately it predicts the fare_amount.

## 4. Visualization
Visualizations play a crucial role in understanding and interpreting the results of our analysis. In this notebook, scatter plots were created to visualize the relationship between the target variable (fare_amount) and the predicted values. This helps us assess the model's ability to capture the patterns in the data. Additionally, a histogram was used to visualize the distribution of residuals, which provides insights into the model's performance and potential areas for improvement.

## 5. Feature Importance
Understanding the importance of each feature in the model is essential for interpreting the results and making informed decisions. By examining the coefficients of the trained linear regression model, we determined the impact of each feature on the fare_amount prediction. Notably, the feature "mean_distance" was found to have the greatest weight in the model's final prediction. This suggests that, on average, the fare amount tends to increase by $7 for every mile traveled. However, it's important to note that due to the presence of correlated features, the interpretation of individual feature effects should be approached with caution.
